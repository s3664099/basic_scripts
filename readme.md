<h3 align="center">Basic Scripts</h3>

##About the Project##
What I am doing here is writing out basic scripts that appeared in various
books from the 70s and 80s. The reason behind this is because most of the
scripts need to be written out by hand, and I found it difficult at times
to copy and paste from pdf files either to run through ChatGPT, or to upload
directly to a convertor.

Instead of simply doing it for myself, I have chosen to allow others to have
access to these scripts as well for their purposes. Acknowledgements should
go to the original authors of the works as opposed to myself.

I have started converting some of these scripts into modern languages, and I'll
include a link to the repository along with a link to the respective book.

Please feel free to add to the lists before, including any other repositories
that contain any conversions.

##Structure##
The structure of this repository is that the first level are the books. If there
there are multiple versions for different machines, then the next level will be
directories representing the machines, and the verions will appear in the
directories. If there is only one machine it will just be the book. However I
will include a readme.md in the directory to provide details on the compatible
machine.
